{"cells":[{"source":"![A soccer pitch for an international match.](soccer-pitch.jpg)\n\nYou're working as a sports journalist at a major online sports media company, specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You've been watching both men's and women's international soccer matches for a number of years, and your gut instinct tells you that more goals are scored in women's international football matches than men's. This would make an interesting investigative article that your subscribers are bound to love, but you'll need to perform a valid statistical hypothesis test to be sure!\n\nWhile scoping this project, you acknowledge that the sport has changed a lot over the years, and performances likely vary a lot depending on the tournament, so you decide to limit the data used in the analysis to only official `FIFA World Cup` matches (not including qualifiers) since `2002-01-01`.\n\nYou create two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which you scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: `women_results.csv` and `men_results.csv`.\n\nThe question you are trying to determine the answer to is:\n\n> Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?\n\nYou assume a **10% significance level**, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n$H_0$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.\n\n$H_A$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.","metadata":{},"id":"3ed0edb2-696b-49ab-9db0-681defcce695","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# importing packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n#

Test\nThe next step in this project is to identify which hypothesis test would be the most appropriate for our specific question.\n\nOur hypothesis is that there are more goals scored on average in women's international soccer matches than in the men's games. Our sample data includes the official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002 to limit some error due to variation and changes in international play over time. \nWe'll use our sample set to test our hypothesis on the greater population of international games. \n\nAs stated before, our hypothesis is that the average goals in women's matches > men's matches, so that's our alternative hypothesis, or $H_A$. The null hypothesis, or $H_0$, is that the average goals scored across both are the same.\n\nSince there are two independent groups, we'll need to perform an unpaired two-sample test.\n\nNext, we'll need to determine if a parametric or non-parametric test is needed, so let's compare distributions to see if they appear to be normally distributed.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f946c55a-5b7b-4360-9c24-19834e6b40ea"},{"source":"# first, we need to create a total goals column within both dataframes to make our calcs
